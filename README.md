Guarantees the generated identifier is unique compared to all other previously stored keys. Export and restore the map entities to facilitate persistence. Validates external UIDs for compliance and uniqueness. 

## Install

```
npm i @justkd/uidmanager
```
```
yarn add @justkd/uidmanager
```

## Use

```
import { UIDManager } from '@justkd/uidmanager'
import type { UIDManagerInterface } from '@justkd/uidmanager'

const manager: UIDManagerInterface = UIDManager()
const key = 'keys can be anything except null, undefined, or NaN'
const uid = manager.generateUIDFor(key)
```
